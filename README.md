This is the new version of my professional website, [klintkanopka.com](https://klintkanopka.com). The short version is that it treats the components of the CV like "blog posts" and dynamically generates a CV page. This is non-trivial amount of work to set up, but the benefit of including things like slides and figures in the posts is a huge win for making an interesting/interactive online portfolio.
