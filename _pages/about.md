I am an Assistant Professor of Applied Statistics in the department of [Applied Statistics, Social Science, and Humanities](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/applied-statistics-social-science-and-humanities) at [NYU Steinhardt](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/). My work centers around joining psychometric modeling with computational methods. In practice, this includes using process data to understand how students are interacting with computerized tests, modeling features (like item order) that may be taken for granted, and using natural language processing to help make sense of respondent generated text. Research-wise, I'm also really interested in probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian statistics, and networks. Personally, I really like traveling, trying new vegan food, craft coffee, and board games.
