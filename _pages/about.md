I am a pscyhometrician, data scientist, and fourth year Ph.D student at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, advised by [Maria Araceli Ruiz-Primo](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/aruiz) and [Ben Domingue](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/bdomingu). My work centers around joining psychometric modeling with computational methods. In practice, this includes using process data to understand how students are interacting with computerized tests, modeling features (like item order) that may be taken for granted, and using natural language processing to help make sense of respondent generated text. I'm also really interested in probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian statistics, networks, and deep learning.
